Machine Learning and Datasets for Malware Analysis.

## Motivation

There are very few projects about Machine Learning for Cybersecurity. One of the main reason for this is the difficulty to find datasets to train models.

We hope this project will help create a community of researchers and developers to work of this exciting field. 

## What will I find here?

- Datasets of all kinds
- ML algorithms and codes
- Scientific papers drafts
